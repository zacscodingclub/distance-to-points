# Calculate Distance to Points

This application takes in a CSV file exported from a GPS data logger and calculates the distance to multiple "base points", then exports the needed data into a new CSV file.


```bash
    # change directory into root
    > npm install

    > node index /path/to/csv_file.csv /path/to/assets.txt
```
